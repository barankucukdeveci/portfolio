# [Project: Traffic Sign Detection & Recognition In Poor Weather Conditions](https://github.com/barankucukdeveci/signdetection/)

This is a project I did for my bachelor's degree, where I augmented traffic sign images and used deep learning to recognize them.

* Dataset is called GTSRB
* Project process documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/barankucukdeveci/signdetection/blob/main/Final.docx)
* Example from the project:
